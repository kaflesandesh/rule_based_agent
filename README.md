# rule_based_agent
A restaurant recommender chatbot in python

This is a system based on rule-based agents (essentially, smart agents based on AI concepts) using Python. It has encountered some issues, so you're welcome to explore this.

The core concept involves filtering restaurants or other topics from the database. The agent operates using predefined logic and implements it within a loop. It prompts users for specific inputs, based on which the agent identifies the appropriate rule.
