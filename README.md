# rule_based_agent
A restaurant recommender chatbot in Python

This system uses Python based on rule-based agents (essentially, smart agents on AI concepts). It has encountered some issues, so you're welcome to explore this.

The core concept involves filtering restaurants or other topics from the database. The agent operates using predefined logic and implements it within a loop. It prompts users for specific inputs, based on which the agent identifies the appropriate rule.
